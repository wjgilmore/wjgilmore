## CodeMash

I'm (now long retired) cofounder of the popular <a href="https://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash Conference</a>, the largest multi-day developer event in the Midwest. Although no longer involved in the organization, I still attend every year in order to take the kids to the companion KidzMash conference. Away from the keyboard you'll find me hanging out with the family, hunched over a chess board, or having fun with DIY electronics.
