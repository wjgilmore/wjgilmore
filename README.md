Over the years I have led many technical due diligence projects (part of the M&A process), and am currently leading the rollout of agentic AI coding processes across the Xenon Partners company portfolio. I recently served as the Executive Chair for the O'Reilly <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/live/ai-superstream-building-saas-businesses-with-ai.html">Building Businesses with AI</a> online conference, and in a surreal moment was interviewed for <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/building-ai-powered-saas-businesses/">O'Reilly Radar</a> about how I use AI to build SaaS products.

## CodeMash

I'm (now long retired) cofounder of the popular <a href="https://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash Conference</a>, the largest multi-day developer event in the Midwest. Although no longer involved in the organization, I still attend every year in order to take the kids to the companion KidzMash conference.

## Hobbies

Computers are my primary thing, but I'm also an obsessive stamp collector. My primary interest is Cold War era stamps, specifically propagandistic stamps from the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, notably East Germany. I love stamps so much that I run a subscription-based business called <a href="https://spiesindc.com">SpiesInDC</a> which turns subscribers into secret agents for a ~3 month period. During this period subscribers receive mission envelopes in the mail (as in their real mailbox) containing Cold War reproduction documents, speech transcripts, maps, and stamps!

I'm also very into fitness, and have inspired many others to get fit through my <a href="https://wjgilmore.com/articles/10000-pushups">10,000 Pushups</a> program. The famous game developer Patrick Wyatt even built a pushup app inspired by my fitness journey! It's called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/push10k/id6754811078">push10K</a> and you can download it for free from the App Store.
