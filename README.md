# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Dublin, Ohio-based software developer, writer and consultant who currently serves as the CTO of no-code mobile app builder <a href="https://www.adalo.com">Adalo</a>, as well as the technical partner at <a href="https://xenon.io">Xenon Partners</a>. Prior to this role I spent two years as CEO of <a href="https://www.teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. Prior to joining Treehouse, I served three years as CTO of <a href="https://www.dreamfactory.com">DreamFactory Software</a>. My career has been devoted to helping companies of all sizes build amazing products.</p>

I'm the author of ~~nine~~ ten books, including the recently published *<a href="https://saasdemosthatsell.com">SaaS Demos That Sell</a>*, bestselling *Beginning PHP and MySQL* series, *<a href="https://leanpub.com/easylaravel">Easy Laravel 5</a>*, *Easy PHP Websites with the Zend Framework*, and *Easy Active Record for Rails Developers*.

Over the years I've published more than 300 articles within popular publications such as Developer.com, JSMag, and Linux Magazine, and instructed hundreds of students in the United States and Europe. Check out my personal website <a href="https://wjgilmore.com">WJGilmore.com</a>.

In my spare time I'm building <a href="https://6dollarcrm.com">6DollarCRM</a>, a cost-effective CRM that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs manage personal and professional relationships.

## CodeMash

I'm (now long retired) cofounder of the popular <a href="https://www.codemash.org/">CodeMash Conference</a>, the largest multi-day developer event in the Midwest. Although I'm no longer involved in the organization, attending the event and companion KidzMash conference has become a much anticipated few days for me and the family. Away from the keyboard you'll find me hanging out with the family, hunched over a chess board, or having fun with DIY electronics.
